# 🌦️ Weather Image Recognition 🧠📷

Welcome to **Weather Image Recognition**! This project utilizes machine learning and advanced neural network architectures to classify weather conditions from images. 🌤️🌧️❄️

## 🚀 Features

- 📂 **Data Handling**: Load, preprocess, and augment weather image datasets.  
- 🖼️ **Image Classification**: Classify weather types (e.g., sunny, rainy, snowy) with high accuracy.  
- 🧠 **Architectures Used**:
  - **Custom CNN**: A lightweight convolutional neural network designed specifically for this task.  
  - **Torchvision Models**: Integrates pre-trained models for transfer learning (e.g., ResNet, VGG).  
- 📈 **Evaluation Metrics**: Analyze model performance with accuracy, confusion matrices, and visualizations.  
- 🔧 **Customizable Pipelines**: Easily adapt the notebook for different datasets or tasks.

## 📈 Sample Workflow

1. Load and preprocess labeled weather images. 🌅🌩️🌨️  
2. Train a custom CNN or fine-tune a pre-trained model (like ResNet).  
3. Evaluate model performance using test datasets.  
4. Visualize predictions and analyze errors.

## 📚 Architectures Used

### 1. **Custom CNN**  
- Designed for lightweight yet effective classification.  
- Includes convolutional layers, max-pooling, and fully connected layers optimized for weather data.

### 2. **Pre-trained Models**  
- Uses `torchvision.models` for transfer learning.  
- Examples: ResNet, VGG, or other deep CNNs, fine-tuned on weather datasets.
